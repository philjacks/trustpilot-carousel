*** CURRENTLY UN-STABLE ***

> Issues with responsiveness 
  (1. doesn't always fit carouselOuter to correct size
   2. When enlarging window the last card has huge gap after it
  )

> Weird glitch when refreshing page
  (the 'card.style.left' varies and makes carousel 'un-scrollable')

  The responsive issues are OK overall but the glitch causes instability.
